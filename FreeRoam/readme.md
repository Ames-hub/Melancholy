This is an experimental concept. It is not yet fully functional... or even made yet.
This is a concept for a free roam mode. It will be a mode where you can explore the world freely.

You will be able to go anywhere in /Areas/ that you want, and do anything possible.

There will be random events as time passes on.
Some of these events may prove dangerous or exciting.
There will be a day/night cycle, and weather effects.

THIS IS PURELY A CONCEPT. IT IS WAY OUT OF MY SKILLSET TO DESIGN AND CODE THIS. ESPECIALLY WITHOUT USING A GAME ENGINE.
I WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHEN I CAN, BUT IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE IT IS FINISHED OR FUNCTIONAL AT ALL.
