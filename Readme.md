STARTING THE GAME

To start the game, Run starter.py. I recommend you start it in Visual Studio Code
as this is where the project was tested (And therefore, recreates the controlled environment)
But that is completely up to you ^^






DETECTIVE WORK
DETECTIVE WORK  [WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED]
DETECTIVE WORK

The game is designed to be played in a linear fashion, but there are some things you can do to change the outcome of the game. (OR get a better result)
One of the main ways you can do this is through "Detective work"

Detective work is a way to find out more about the world around you, and the people in it.
It will almost never be called out that "now is the time to do detective work" but sometimes, it is an option.

If you Think that detective work is possible, Simply type what you think is a hidden option
and the game will tell you if you can do that or not

Note from dev: 
If you look at the code to find out when you can do detective work, Shame on you T~T

starter.py
This program contains a shit ton of Back-end code, It makes sure all variables are valid and that the game runs with as few bugs as possible.
It sets up the database, and it sets up logging for debug.

This is the first chapter of the game, intended to be story rich while also being a tutorial for the game.
