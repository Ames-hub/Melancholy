Game info
This game tells the story of 2 girls, Both Torn apart by the world around them. Will you aid them on their recovery from trauma or will you let them fall?

This game was inspired by the characters of Undertale. This is my own take on the background of Chara and Frisk, The game is not a direct copy of Undertale, but it is inspired by it.
All characters and art are made by me, I do not own Undertale or any of its characters. Toby Fox owns Undertale, its characters, Music and art.

To start the game, Run starter.py. I recommend you start it in Visual Studio Code
as this is where the project was tested (And therefore, recreates the controlled environment)
But that is completely up to you ^^
